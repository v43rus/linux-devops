[![View Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Documentation-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://v43rus.github.io/linux-devops/)

Personal learning notes from the ZTM DevOps Bootcamp (Linux System Administrator track) along with other sources.

This is a work in progress and will be continually updated as I go along with the course, even when done I will keep updating this repository as I learn new things which I think is relevant.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository documents my journey learning DevOps and Linux system administration. I'm learning in public to:
- Solidify my understanding through teaching
- Create reusable resources for myself and others
- Share knowledge with fellow students and the community
- Demonstrate continuous learning to potential employers
